# Image Upload Fix Summary

## Problem

Your React Native Expo app was experiencing `[StorageUnknownError: Network request failed]` when submitting reports with images. This was caused by improper image handling in the upload process.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Upload Utility (`utils/uploadImage.ts`)

- **Proper Image Conversion**: Uses `expo-file-system` to convert image URIs to base64
- **ArrayBuffer Conversion**: Uses `base64-arraybuffer` package to convert base64 to ArrayBuffer
- **Supabase Storage Upload**: Uploads ArrayBuffer with correct `contentType: 'image/jpeg'`
- **Public URL Retrieval**: Gets public URL using `getPublicUrl` method
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for different failure scenarios

### 2. Updated Report Screen (`app/(tabs)/report.tsx`)

- **Replaced Old Upload Function**: Removed `uploadImageToStorage` from supabase.ts
- **Integrated New Utility**: Uses the new `uploadImage` function from utils
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added URI format validation (`file://` or `content://`)
- **File Size Checking**: Added optional file size validation (50MB limit)
- **Retry Mechanism**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff for failed uploads
- **Progress Tracking**: Enhanced upload progress indicator
- **Better Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages with retry options

### 3. Dependencies Added

- ✅ `expo-file-system` (already installed)
- ✅ `base64-arraybuffer` (newly installed)

### 4. Key Features of the New Upload Flow

#### Step 1: Image URI Validation

```typescript
// Validates image URI format
if (!uri.startsWith("file://") && !uri.startsWith("content://")) {
  throw new Error("Invalid image URI format. Please take a new photo.");
}
```

#### Step 2: Base64 Conversion

```typescript
// Convert image URI to base64 using expo-file-system
const base64Data = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(uri, {
  encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64,
});
```

#### Step 3: ArrayBuffer Conversion

```typescript
// Convert base64 to ArrayBuffer
const arrayBuffer = decode(base64Data);
```

#### Step 4: Supabase Storage Upload

```typescript
// Upload to Supabase Storage with correct contentType
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from("urbaneye-issues")
  .upload(fileName, arrayBuffer, {
    contentType: "image/jpeg",
    cacheControl: "3600",
    upsert: false,
  });
```

#### Step 5: Public URL Retrieval

```typescript
// Get public URL for the uploaded image
const {
  data: { publicUrl },
} = supabase.storage.from("urbaneye-issues").getPublicUrl(fileName);
```

### 5. Error Handling Improvements

- **Network Errors**: Specific handling for network failures
- **File Validation**: Checks for file existence and accessibility
- **Size Validation**: Prevents upload of extremely large files
- **Format Validation**: Ensures proper image URI format
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with actionable steps

### 6. Testing Features Added

- **Test Upload Button**: Allows testing image upload without submitting report
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed console logs for debugging
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback during upload process
- **Connection Testing**: Storage connection validation

### 7. Image Processing Improvements

- **Compression**: Image compression before upload (1024px max width, 80% quality)
- **EXIF Disabled**: Prevents metadata-related issues
- **Format Validation**: Ensures proper image format handling

## How to Use

### 1. Take or Select Image

- Use camera or gallery picker
- Image URI is automatically validated
- File size is checked (optional)

### 2. AI Analysis

- Analyze image with Gemini AI (required)
- Get issue type, severity, and description

### 3. Capture Location

- Get current GPS coordinates
- Validate location accuracy

### 4. Submit Report

- Image is automatically uploaded to Supabase Storage
- Progress is shown during upload
- Public URL is stored in database
- Success/error messages are displayed

## Testing

### Test Upload Button

- Select an image first
- Click "Test Upload" button
- Verify upload success/failure
- Test file is automatically cleaned up

### Debug Features

- Storage connection testing
- Detailed console logging
- Error message categorization

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Uploads**: Proper image conversion eliminates network errors
2. **Better UX**: Progress indicators and clear error messages
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
4. **Performance**: Image compression reduces upload time and bandwidth
5. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting
6. **Validation**: Multiple validation layers prevent common issues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Network request failed"**

   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Supabase configuration
   - Try the retry mechanism

2. **"Invalid image format"**

   - Take a new photo
   - Ensure camera permissions are granted
   - Check image picker configuration

3. **"Storage bucket not accessible"**

   - Verify Supabase credentials
   - Check storage policies
   - Ensure user is authenticated

4. **"Image file too large"**
   - Take a smaller photo
   - Image compression should help automatically

### Debug Steps

1. Check console logs for detailed error information
2. Use "Test Upload" button to isolate upload issues
3. Verify storage connection with "Test" button
4. Check network connectivity
5. Validate Supabase configuration

## Files Modified

- `utils/uploadImage.ts` (new file)
- `app/(tabs)/report.tsx` (updated)
- `package.json` (dependencies added)

## Next Steps

1. **Test the new upload flow** with various image types and sizes
2. **Monitor console logs** for any remaining issues
3. **Verify database storage** of image URLs
4. **Test on different devices** to ensure compatibility
5. **Monitor upload performance** and adjust compression settings if needed

The image upload should now work reliably with proper error handling and user feedback!
